This project is intended as a means of spreading space culture.
We believe that it is a topic that has regained strength after being forgotten. Now, because of public interest, it is a great moment to show them  how incredible space can be and how close we can


The user will be able to interact with three parts of the page, each part  works with an special API to retrieve different kind of data.

Rover Photos:
The user will be able to choose a  range of dates  that will display the images that were taken on those dates. Since the dates are not linear, we choose to make them random and it displays 10 random days. After that the user picks one and it displays the first 5 photos of that day, which usually they are very cool.

Closest Object:
The user will be able  to choose a range of dates that will display information about the closest objects around the earth on those dates. Similar to the rover, it picks 10 random days and shows the 5 objects near earth at that time.

Image of the day:
The user will be able to see a displayed cosmos image every day, which we retrive from the NASA picture of the day api.

As you can see, the app works with 3 api.

The main part of the page is the js, which lets us do all this.

We also used tailwind to style the page and our css.
